Lights from \{ID\} tags are captured by the standard camera which allows low cost of the overall solution, high flexibility of changing \{ID\} if needed and resistance against changes in ambient light. The proposed localization algorithm is capable of detecting not only position but also direction of the vehicle. Algorithm has been implemented in the OpenCV framework and tested on multiple E-puck mobile robotic platforms. Output of the algorithm can be used for real-time navigation of the vehicle inside parking house, applicable for both indoor and outdoor environments. },

The method interchanges identification numbers among multiple robots via audible beeps multiplexed by frequency. The identification sound is sent only when robots approach to each other.
