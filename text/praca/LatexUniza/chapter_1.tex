\chapter{Deep reinforcement learning}
In this chapter we will put \ac{DRL} into the context of broader field of artificial intelligence and explain how it differs from other approaches that attempt to infuse agents with some form of intelligence. Afterwards we will proceed to introduce the main algorithms that are relevant for the use in environments with continuous action spaces.
